## Security Test Report (Backend & Frontend)

**Date:** 2025-06-08

**Tested By:** Manus AI

**Summary:**
Security testing was conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities in both the backend API and the frontend applications (web and mobile). The focus was on common web application security risks, data protection, and authentication/authorization mechanisms.

**Test Cases & Results:**

1.  **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** JWT tokens are used for authentication. Access to protected routes requires a valid token. Unauthorized access attempts are rejected. Password hashing is implemented.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Status:** PASS (basic)
    *   **Details:** Basic input validation is in place to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Further comprehensive validation for all input fields is recommended for production.

3.  **Data Transmission Security (HTTPS):**
    *   **Status:** N/A (Assumed for deployment)
    *   **Details:** The current development environment does not enforce HTTPS, but it is a critical requirement for production deployment to secure data in transit.

4.  **Error Handling and Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** Error messages are generic and do not expose sensitive system information. Detailed error logs are maintained on the server side.

5.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
    *   **Status:** PASS (basic)
    *   **Details:** Frontend frameworks (React, React Native) provide built-in protections against XSS. User-generated content is sanitized before rendering.

6.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
    *   **Status:** N/A (API-based, stateless JWTs mitigate traditional CSRF)
    *   **Details:** Given the stateless nature of JWTs used for API authentication, traditional CSRF attacks are less of a concern. However, proper SameSite cookie policies and origin checks should be implemented if session-based authentication were used.

7.  **Sensitive Data Storage:**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** Passwords are stored as hashes. Sensitive user data is handled with care. Token storage on mobile (SecureStore) is utilized.

**Conclusion:**
The application demonstrates a reasonable level of security for its current development stage. Key security measures like authentication, authorization, and basic input validation are in place. For a production environment, a more in-depth security audit, penetration testing, and adherence to industry best practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10) are strongly recommended. Implementing HTTPS and comprehensive input validation across all endpoints will be crucial.
