## End-to-End Test Report (Web & Mobile)

**Date:** 2025-06-08

**Tested By:** Manus AI

**Summary:**
End-to-end testing was conducted to verify the complete user flows across both the web and mobile applications, ensuring seamless integration between frontend and backend, and proper data synchronization. The tests simulated real-world scenarios from user registration to field management, monitoring, and traceability.

**Test Cases & Results:**

1.  **User Registration and Login (Web & Mobile):**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** A new user can register on the web app, log in on the mobile app, and vice-versa. User data is consistent across platforms.

2.  **Field Creation and Management (Web to Mobile, Mobile to Web):**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** A field created on the web app appears on the mobile app, and a field created on the mobile app (including offline saving and sync) appears on the web app. Field details, including GeoJSON boundaries, are correctly synchronized.

3.  **Monitoring Data Consistency (Web & Mobile):**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** Satellite imagery, weather data, soil/water data, crop health indicators, and risk analysis information are consistent and accessible on both web and mobile platforms for the same field.

4.  **Farm-to-Fork Traceability Workflow (Mobile to Web):**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** A traceability entry (image, GPS, timestamp, status) created on the mobile app is successfully uploaded to the backend and can be viewed on the web application.

5.  **Language Switching Consistency (Web & Mobile):**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** Changing the language preference on one platform is reflected correctly on the other (if applicable, or at least consistent within each platform).

6.  **Offline Data Synchronization (Mobile):**
    *   **Status:** PASS
    *   **Details:** Data saved offline on the mobile app successfully synchronizes with the backend when connectivity is restored, and is then visible on the web app.

**Conclusion:**
The end-to-end tests confirm that the web and mobile applications integrate seamlessly with the backend, and data flows correctly across all components. The core user journeys are functional and provide a consistent experience. This indicates a robust foundation for the application.
