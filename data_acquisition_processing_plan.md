## Data Acquisition and Processing Setup - Initial Plan:

**1. Python Environment Setup:**

*   **Libraries Installed:** `eodag` (for satellite data access), `rasterio`, `xarray`, `rioxarray`, `numpy`, `scipy` (for data processing).

**2. Sentinel-2 Data Access (using `eodag`):**

*   **Authentication:** The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem requires an access token for data download via OData and OpenSearch API. This token can be generated using cURL or a Python script. It's crucial *not* to hardcode username and password in the application code due to security risks.
*   **`eodag` Configuration:** `eodag` can be configured to use the `cop_dataspace` provider. This will likely involve setting up a configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/eodag/eodag.yml`) with authentication details or passing them programmatically.
*   **Search and Download:** The `eodag.search()` method can be used to find Sentinel-2 products (e.g., `S2_MSI_L1C` or `S2_MSI_L2A`) based on geographic coordinates, dates, and cloud cover. The `eodag.download()` method will then be used to retrieve the actual data.

**3. Data Processing (using `rasterio`, `xarray`, `rioxarray`, `numpy`, `scipy`):**

*   **Cloud Masking:** Sentinel-2 Level 2A products include a Scene Classification Map (SCL) band that can be used for cloud masking. For Level 1C data, more advanced cloud detection algorithms might be necessary.
*   **Atmospheric Correction:** Level 2A products are already atmospherically corrected. If using Level 1C, atmospheric correction will be a critical step to ensure accurate vegetation index calculations. Libraries like `sen2cor` (though not directly integrated into our Python environment yet) or other radiative transfer models could be considered.
*   **Vegetation Index Calculation:** Implement functions to calculate common vegetation indices:
    *   **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** `(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)`
    *   **EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index):** `2.5 * ((NIR - Red) / (NIR + 6 * Red - 7.5 * Blue + 1))`
    *   Other relevant indices (e.g., SAVI, GCI) can be added as needed.

**4. Local Data Storage:**

*   Processed satellite imagery and derived vegetation index maps will need to be stored locally (or in a cloud storage solution) for efficient access by the backend and frontend. A structured directory system based on date and field ID would be beneficial.

**Next Steps for Implementation:**

*   **Authentication:** Securely handle user authentication with the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem to obtain access tokens.
*   **`eodag` Integration:** Refine the `data_acquisition.py` script to properly configure `eodag` with authentication and implement robust search and download functionalities.
*   **Processing Pipeline:** Develop a modular processing pipeline for cloud masking, atmospheric correction (if needed), and vegetation index calculation.
*   **Data Management:** Design and implement a strategy for storing and managing the downloaded and processed data.
