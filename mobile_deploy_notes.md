# Mobile Application Deployment Notes (Placeholder)

# Mobile application deployment involves:
# 1. Building the Expo project for iOS and Android platforms.
#    - `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
#    - `eas build --platform android --profile production`
# 2. Submitting the built binaries to Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
#    - Requires developer accounts, app-specific information, screenshots, privacy policies, etc.
# 3. Managing app versions and updates.

# This process is typically manual or semi-automated through CI/CD pipelines specific to mobile development.
